## Chatbot front end prototype

#### Functionality
- If a user query (parsed) matches one of the queries previously loaded, the bot responds with a randomly selected answer from the matched category
- Otherwise, the bot responds with a randomly selected answer from the stored generic answers list
- The app displays "Typing..." before displaying its answer to emulate the time it takes to look for the answer

#### User interface
- Queries and answers are displayed in oposite sides of the chat area
- Queries have a different background color than answers

#### Next steps
- On page load, hide the chat window.  Instead, display a button that would open it when clicked
- Add a button to close the chat window
- Allow for older chat lines to scroll up out of site when new lines reach the bottom of the screen
